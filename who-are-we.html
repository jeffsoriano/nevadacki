                <p>Circle K is the largest collegiate community service, leadership development, and friendship organization in the world. Circle K clubs are organized and sponsored by a Kiwanis club on a college or university campus. It is a self-governing organization and elects its own officers, conducts its own meetings, and determines its own service activities. This high degree of autonomy allows for a unique service experience driven entirely by the members for the members.</p>
                <p>Circle K is an international community service organization with over 13,250 members worldwide in 17 nations, including the Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Colombia, Philippines, Nigeria, Ecuador, Malaysia, Panama, Dominican Republic, Taiwan, Antigua, Australia, Suriname, and the United States. Circle K blends community service and leadership training with the opportunity to meet many other college students at service projects, conferences, and conventions and form genuine lifelong friendships with people of all walks of life.</p>
                <p>UNR Circle K is a part of this international family.  We are a highly independent club entirely run by active members, collaborating with our local community to implement important service projects. UNR Circle K also works within a broader geographic sense, often traveling to California to work with the rest of our district. This extends our opportunities to serve and to meet many different people, making Circle K a significant part of many of our members' college experience.</p>

                <h2>Service</h2>
                <p>Service is the main hallmark of Circle K International. CKI members from around the world contribute to their communities and make the world a better place, collectively performing over a million hours of service every year. Nevada CKI directly impacts the local community by cleaning the Truckee River, building trails along the Tahoe Rim, hosting holiday events for elementary school children, volunteering at Relay For Life, and more! Our service also extends to the state of California, where we help the other clubs in our division with their own projects.</p>
                <h2>Leadership</h2>
                <p>As a highly autonomous club, we give our members the opportunity to hold positions of power that govern the different administrative and executive duties of the club. These leadership responsibilities can be found at all levels of CKI and are accessible to anyone willing to pay it forward and to bringing out the best in themselves and in those around them.</p>
                <h2>Fellowship</h2>
                 <p>Perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of Circle K is the potential to build lifelong relationships. Whether we are participating in a service project or just having fun during one of our many socials, you will find a friend here at Nevada CKI. Our members have the opportunity to meet with a broad range of people, from student to active community member to Kiwanian. To top it all off, we're one of the friendliest clubs you'll ever meet.</p>

                <h3>Kiwanis Bike Shop II</h3>
                <h4>February 4th, 2015</h4>

                <p><center>Wheels a-turnin’. Bikes a-rollin’. Get ready to get your Bike Shop on! This past Friday,January 30th from 3:00pm to 5:00pm was the very first bike shop of the spring semester. Led by event chair Moss Boss, we (Alex Swaglione, new member Robert Meyers, and I) all ventured off into the land of Kiwanis where the bikes were bountiful. There were many types of bikes: small bikes, big bikes, Burning Man bikes, and even scooters. But we didn’t start working with bikes at first.</p>
                <p>We first moved ton of heavy furniture and pieces of scrap metal to the front garage to bedonated to the Salvation Army. Kiwanian Roger asked us if we wanted any of the furniture, but none of us wanted to lug around a 100 pound metal desk. After we moved furniture, we went outside and sorted a trailer full of donated and used bikes. With the help of Kiwanian Kevin, we sorted salvageable bikes to one side of the open lot and sorted broken bikes to the other side. After we emptied the trailer, we loaded the broken bikes back onto the trailer to be recycled. We  did the same exact process for the bike wheel frames. Since they were disc-shaped and circular, we started throwing them like Frisbees into another trailer until the trailer was completely full. Thankfully no one was hurt!</p>
                <p>When we finished, we relocated back inside Bike Shop and moved Burning Man Bikes up to the second floor. We got some help with a few Key Clubbers at this point, so it was nice working with them and seeing most of the Kiwanis family together in one place. Since we moved so many bikes up to the second floor, the ground floor was a mess. So we organized the bikes there too. We propped them up and organized them into kid bikes and adult bikes. Finally, we threw more scrap metal into the recycling and placed used parts into their appropriate bins.</p>
                <p>Even though we did not have time to actually fix bikes, it was still a fun and enjoyableevent. New member Robert said that he would be back soon and Alex Swaglione even bought a bike lock from Kiwanian Ellen. Funny thing is, Swaglione doesn’t even own a bike! This is a super easy event to chair, and this is a great event if you want to get down and dirty with some bikes! I recommend members, especially new members, to go to this event at least once while they’re in Circle K!</p></center></b></p>

                <p><center>As the name of the event implies, this was a large convention at the Grand Sierra Resort catered to future brides and their husbands, families, etc. The host, American Heart Association, a nonprofit organization, has graciously accepted us as volunteers for more than 5 consecutive years; so yes, it is an annual event! Anyhow, the 8 of us (Johnathan, Westin, Amanda 1/Amanda 2, Alyza, Rachel, Ryan, and myself) were given different jobs ranging from bridal registration to coat check-in. The hours were a bit slow in the beginning, but the catering booths made it up by offering tons of free food samples! There were tons of booths, offering wedding dresses, suit-fitting, artisanal eats, and even matching sets of cutlery, wow! So, the next time you plan on getting hitched, come on by to the Wedding Fair next year! If not, it is a rewarding volunteer experience with nice tasty perks and kind coordinators. 10/10</center></b></p>

                <h3>Night of All Nations</h3>
                <h4>December 1st, 2014</h4>

                <p><center>Night of All Nations is definitely one of my favorite volunteering events each year. It combines different cultures, delicious food, amazing talent acts, and FREE t-shirts! What more could I ask for? This year I had the opportunity to work with the international students from Brazil. All I did was basically help them set up their cultural booth so they can share with the visitors more information about their country. After I helped the Brazilians I was free to roam around and help where else was needed.</p>
                <p>I ended up meeting with other Circle K members from my club and together we decided to, “Explore the world!” We ate at many different food stops and made sure to try everything that was put on our plate. I devoured curry from India, crepes from Ethiopia, noodles from Taiwan, and even udon from Japan. I would have to say that the sweet rice from Brazil was definitely my favorite item that night.</p>
                <p>During the dinner many different culture acts were also displayed. I saw everything from people breaking boards of wood with their fists to Irish river dancers. I couldn’t help myself from getting down when I saw the Hawaiian hula dancers shaking their hips. I am definitely no expert at hip shaking, but being in the Pacific Islander’s club for three years helped. Not only did I have the chance to interact with people from all over the world, I even got to take pictures with them! <b>Night of All Nations was an amazing event from start to finish. I can’t wait till next year so I can volunteer again!</center></b></p>

                <p><center>On a very cold Sunday morning we all headed to Victorian Square where the event was being held. We had to first sign up at a little office at the train depot where they had chicken soup, chili, crackers, doughnuts, hot chocolate, coffee, and water all ready for the volunteers. Angie, Marina, and I were placed at the soda bottle ring toss. The rules were that if they toss a ring onto a soda, they won and would be rewarded a soda plus some red tickets for prizes. Honestly the game was really hard. I think there was about 4 kids who were actually able to toss a ring onto a soda bottle. The three of us later took a short break and saw how lively the event actually was. There were lots of families with their children all decked out in cute and amazing costumes, great performances like the pumpkin race, pumpkin seed spitting contest, live singing, and much more.
                <br><p>After our break we got assigned to a new station, the Pumpkin Beauty Salon. I helped a lot of kids paint and decorate their pumpkins while their parents took endless photos of their children. A really disastrous moment was when a little boy (about 4 or 5) in a Captain America costume tried to open a paint bottle and the paint splattered all over him and me. As the day progressed Angie, Marina, and I were again assigned to another shift. This time it was the Which Key Is It game. The player had to choose which of the two doors they wanted to try to open and then pick from a bunch of keys and if the key opened the door then they’d win a prize. This game wasn’t as hard as the ring toss one, but it could be really confusing at times because the keys all looked alike. The first door I tried to open I found the key instantly and then when I tried to open the second door it literally took me 5 tries to find the right key. <b>I also invited some of my friends to volunteer at this event and they all said they enjoyed it and are now considering joining CKI, which makes me pretty happy that I picked a really fun event for them to come volunteer at.</b> Well that was my experience at Pumpkin Palooza and I can definitely say that even though it was super busy, I had a really fun time volunteering at this event.</center></p>

                <h4>July 24th, 2014</h4>

                <p><center>In Circle K, we like to focus on service. Whether it is for the community, for our campus, or for our friends, we are always willing to lend a helping hand. Yes, sometimes we get freebies, and sometimes we even get some free food. But for our wonderful members, service is so much mroe than receiving things</p>
                <p>Service is about helping <b>just because we like to help!</b></p>
                <p>Some of the most rewarding service events are ones where we get to interact with people or see our progress. It is rewarding to see that your work has helped someone in need, that you have made a difference in the community, or that you have just brightened someone's day. Nevada Circle K has made a huge impact in the Reno/Sparks community by cleaning up parks, helping the food bank, working at events on campus, and volunteering with other organizations. As a member, your efforts don't go unnoticed.</p>
                <p>We are the people that make events happen and change lives.</p>
                <p><b>We are volunteers, we are Circle K.</center></b></p>
